# Project 3: Email Template
_Module 4: October 27–November 9_
Due on Wednesday, November 10

For this assignment create an email template to send/share your e-greetings. Keep in mind that JavaScript and CSS animation will not execute in most email clients, so you’ll need an email to let someone know they’ve received a card and then direct them to the webpage to see the card in action. Focus on what will entice someone to click through to the actual card.

A good place to start is to sign up for some product emails to see what they have in common and to determine what might need to be unique for your particular brand concept.

You can choose how you want to implement the email. Some options include:
- Can use [PHP to send an email](https://css-tricks.com/sending-nice-html-email-with-php/)
- Can use a service like [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/)

You might find guide’s like [Mailchimp’s Email Design Guide](https://mailchimp.com/email-design-guide/) helpful.
